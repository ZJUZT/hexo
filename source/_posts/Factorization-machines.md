## Theory

## Implementation

### Installation

* Dependencies
* numpy + mkl
* Scipy
* sklearn (dependent on the two wheels above)
* Note:  most ML-related packages need a fortran complier, so if you use pip or python install, you'd better have MinGW installed beforehand. Of course, you can choose other python distribution like Enthought or Aconada. These distributions contain hundreds of ML-related packages. Here I recommend you download whl (complied package) from this website(<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>).
